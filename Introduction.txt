SQL - Structured query language
Used to manipulate and access data from DB

RDBMS - Relational DataBase Management System
Stores data in the form of rows(record) and columns(fields) in a table.
The tables can be related with one another.

----to view list of tables in db
information_schema.tables will contain the list of tables
or pg_catalog.pg_tables 

SELECT tablename 
FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables   
WHERE schemaname != 'information_schema' AND schemaname !=  'pg_catalog'  
ORDER BY tablename 

----to view list of tables in db using psql
\dt or \dt+

----column information of tables will be stored
 in information_schema.column filter by table name

-------types of SQL Commands
1. DDL- Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate
2. DML- Insert, Update, Delete, Merge
3. TCL- Commit, Rollback and Savepoint
4. DCL- Grant, Revoke
5. DQL - Select

-----why normalization
1. remove duplicate data
2. reduces database anomalies
3. reduce redundancy
4. larger DB into smaller tables which are linked


1NF - all attributes in table will contain only atomic value
2NF - no partial dependency(non prime key dependant on part of primary key)
3NF - no transitive dependency(non primary key dependant on non primary key)
BCNF - LHS of functional dependency must be super key 
4 NF - no multivalued dependency(for single value of A, more than one value of B exists)
5 NF - no Join dependency(R can be broken in to R1,R2..and rejoined back to R)
